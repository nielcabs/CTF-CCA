A high-level programming language that was developed in the late 1950s for business applications. 
It is a statically typed, procedural language, meaning that it follows a strict set of rules for organizing and executing code, and that variables must be declared with a specific data type.
It is primarily used for business applications, such as financial systems, payroll, and accounting, and is known for its English-like syntax and its use of verbose, descriptive names for variables and programs. 
It is still used today, although it has largely been replaced by newer, more modern programming languages in many industries.
